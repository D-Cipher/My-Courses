    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System,
        the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical
        object known to harbor life.</p>
    <p>Within its first billion years, life appeared in Earth's oceans and began to affect its
        atmosphere and surface, promoting the proliferation of aerobic as well as anaerobic
        organisms. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, its physical
        properties and its geological history have allowed life to thrive and evolve. The
        earliest undisputed life on Earth arose at least 3.5 billion years ago. Earlier
        physical evidence of life includes graphite, a biogenic substance, in 3.7
        billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in southwestern Greenland, as well
        as, "remains of biotic life" found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.
        Earth's biodiversity has expanded continually except when interrupted by mass
        extinctions. Although scholars estimate that over 99% of all species of life
        (over five billion) that ever lived on Earth are extinct, there are still an estimated
        10–14 million extant species, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over
        86% have not yet been described. Over 7.3 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its
        biosphere and minerals for their survival. Earth's human population is divided among
        about two hundred sovereign states which interact through diplomacy, conflict, travel,
        trade and communication media.</p>
