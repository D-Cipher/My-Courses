#Creating Arrays
np.arange(0,10) #creates array 1 to 9

np.zeros(3) #creates array of zeros

np.zeros((2,3)) #2 by 3 matrix of zeros

np.ones((2,3)) #2 by 3 matrix of ones

np.linspace(0,1,10) #10 evenly spaced points from 0 to 1

np.eye(4) #4x4 matrix with diagonal of 1s

#Creating Matrix
numls = np.arange(50)

numls_matrix = numls.reshape(5,10) #change the dim of array to 5x5 matrix (rows x rols == elements in array)

Practice: create a matrix 5x5 of values 1 to 50 and get the columns 3 to end.
