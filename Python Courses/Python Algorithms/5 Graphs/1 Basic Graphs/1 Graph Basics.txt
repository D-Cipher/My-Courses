Graphs

Graphs -> set of values that are related in a pair wise function.
- Node -> item in the graph
- Edge -> connections between the graphs
- Root Node -> Node that is the ancestor to all other nodes.
- Ancestor Node -> Node that has children.
- Leaf Node -> Nodes with no children.
- Neighbors -> All connected nodes of a node.

Traversal -> Search every node in a graph or tree.

Graph Types:

Direction
1) Directed -> Movement between node is one way.
- {v1:[v2,v3]}, v1 is pointing to v2 and v3, but not the other way around. 

2) Undirected -> Movement between node is bi-directional. 
- {v1:[v2,v3], v2:[v1], v3:[v1]} v1 is pointing to v2 and v3, and both are pointing to v1.

Weighting
1) Weighted -> edges have values
2) Unweighted -> edges have no values

Cycle
1) Cyclic -> One edge start from one node and end at same node. Forms a cycle.
2) Acyclic -> No edges start from one node and end at same node. Does not form a cycle.
