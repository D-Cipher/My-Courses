'''
Given a list of packages that we need to build and the order of the dependencies for each package, how can we determine a valid order in which to build the packages?

Example: 
1) Package 1 has no dependencies
2) Package 2 has dependencies on 1
3) Package 3 has dependencies on 1
4) Package 4 has dependencies on 2,3
5) Package 5 has dependencies on 3,6
6) Package 6 has dependencies on 1,2,3
