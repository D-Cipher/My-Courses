Trees

Trees -> A connected acyclic undirected graph.

Binary Tree -> A tree where every node has at most 2 children

Types of Binary Trees:

1) Balanced Tree -> Binary tree where depth of two subtrees of every node does NOT differ by more than 1.

       10    
      /  \
     20   12
    /
   5
- Depth of left is 2 and right is 1, difference is 1. So balanced tree.

2) Unbalanced Tree -> Binary tree where depth of two subtrees of every node DOES differ by more than 1.

     20
