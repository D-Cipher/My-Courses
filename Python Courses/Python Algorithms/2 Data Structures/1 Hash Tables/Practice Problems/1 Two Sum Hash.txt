'''
Use a Hash Table to solve this problem. Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
'''

arr = [1,7,8,10,15]
target = 9

ht = dict()
ans = None

for i in range(len(arr)):
  hf = target - arr[i]

  if hf in ht:
    ans = [ht[hf], i]
    break
  else:
    ht[arr[i]] = i

print(ans)
