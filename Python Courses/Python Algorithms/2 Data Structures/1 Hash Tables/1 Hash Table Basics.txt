Hash Table

Hashing -> Generating a value from a string using a math formula.
- IDs are result of hashing.

Hash Table -> Hash Table is a data structure which stores data with key value pair.

Hash Value -> Represents the original string of characters.

Slots -> Each postion of the hash table that can hold an item.

Hash Function -> takes a string of characters (key) and maps it to a value of certain length (hash).
- Easy to compute
- Uniform distribution
- Low collisions
- Load Factor = number of items / table size

Example:
'''
Use a Hash Table to solve this problem. Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

arr = [1,7,8,10,15]
target = 9

ht = dict()
ans = None

for i in range(len(arr)):
  hf = target - arr[i]

  if hf in ht:
    ans = [ht[hf], i]
    break
  else:
    ht[arr[i]] = i

print(ans)
