Hash Collisions

Collision -> When a key maps to an already occupied slot in a table.

Handling Collisions:

1) Chaining -> Make each cell of the table point to a linked list.
- Easy to implement
- Hash tables never full
- Cache performance not good
- Extra space required increasing search time O(N)
- Used when number of keys is unknown

2) Open Addressing -> Probe through the table until an available slot is found.
- Linear probing -> Probe to the next slot.
- More complex to implement
- Hash tables can get full
- Better caching performance
- No extra space required
- Used when frequency and number of keys known
