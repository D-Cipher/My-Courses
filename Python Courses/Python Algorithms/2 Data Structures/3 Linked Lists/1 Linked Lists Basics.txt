Linked Lists

Link List -> Linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous order in memory, instead each element contains a pointer than points to the next element.
- Example: 5->1->3->7
- Head is start of linked list
- Tail is end of linked list
- Advantage: insert and deletions at te begining of linked list is O(1)
- Disadvantage: cannot use binary search since sorting difficult

1) Singly Linked List -> One node only points to the next node

2) Doubly Linked List -> One node points to both the next node and previous node
