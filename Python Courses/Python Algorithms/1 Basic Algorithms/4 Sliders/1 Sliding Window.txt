#=== Sliding Window ===

Sliding window algorithm is used to perform searches or operations with a window size. Window starts from the 1st element and keeps shifting right by n elements. The objective is to find the minimum k numbers present in each window to meet the search or operation criteria.

'''
# Given an array of integer of size N, find maximum sum of a continuous subarry of size K
'''
arr = [80,-50,90,100] #ans = 190
n = 4
k = 2

# Brute Force Approach
ans = arr[0]

for i in range(len(arr)):
  currentsum = 0
  for j in range(k):
    if (j + i < len(arr)):
      currentsum = currentsum + arr[j + i]
      ans = max(currentsum, ans)

#print(ans)

# Sliding Window Approach
windowSum = 0

for i in range(k):
  windowSum += arr[i]
  #print(windowSum)

for i in range(len(arr)-k):
  windowSum = windowSum + arr[i+k] - arr[i]
  #print(windowSum)
  ans = max(currentsum, ans)

print(ans)
