'''
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

import math

arr = [2,5,6,7,11,15]
target = 17

strt = 0
end = len(arr) - 1
ans = None

while strt <= end:
  total = arr[strt] + arr[end]

  if total > target:
    end -= 1
  elif total < target:
    strt += 1
  else:
    ans = [strt,end]
    break

print(ans)
