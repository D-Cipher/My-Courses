'''
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:

Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Note:

You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.

arr = [0,8,3,0,1]

for i in range(pointer, len(arr)):
