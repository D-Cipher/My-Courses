'''
Recursion: Count Vowels
Write a function that recursively returns the number of vowels in a string.

If it wasn't clear enough already, you should use recursion in your solution.

Examples
countVowels("apple") = 2

countVowels("cheesecake") = 5

countVowels("bbb") = 0

countVowels("") = 0
Notes
Recursive functions call themselves.
All letters will be in lower case.
For this challenge, the vowels are a, e, i, o, and u.

def countVowels(word, pt=0, count=0):
  vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u']

  if pt >= len(word):
    return count

  if word[pt] in vowels:
    count +=1

  pt += 1

  return countVowels(word,pt,count)

print(countVowels('apple'))
