Recursion

Recursion -> Self-referencing function that refers to itself.

Base Case -> Stop point for the recursive function.

Steps:
1. Identify base case
2. Identify recursive case
3. Get closer to base case till return when needed. Usually 2 returns.

```
def inception(number):

  if number <= 0:
    return None
  number -= 1

  print(number)

  return inception(number)

print(inception(5))
```
