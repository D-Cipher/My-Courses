First, complete the following class definition:

class BankAccount:
    """ Class definition modeling the behavior of a simple bank account """

    def __init__(self, initial_balance):
        """Creates an account with the given balance."""
        …
    def deposit(self, amount):
        """Deposits the amount into the account."""
        …
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """
        Withdraws the amount from the account. Each withdrawal resulting 
        in a negative balance also deducts a penalty fee of 5 dollars
        from the balance.
        """
        …
    def get_balance(self):
        """Returns the current balance in the account."""
        …
    def get_fees(self):
        """Returns the total fees ever deducted from the account."""

The \color{red}{\verb|deposit|}deposit and \color{red}{\verb|withdraw|}withdraw methods each change the account balance. The \color{red}{\verb|withdraw|}withdraw method also deducts a fee of 5 dollars from the balance if the withdrawal (before any fees) results in a negative balance. Since we also have the method \color{red}{\verb|get_fees|}get_fees, you will need to have a variable to keep track of the fees paid.

Here's one possible test of the class. It should print the values 10 and 5, respectively, since the withdrawal incurs a fee of 5 dollars.

my_account = BankAccount(10)
my_account.withdraw(15)
my_account.deposit(20)
print my_account.get_balance(), my_account.get_fees()

Copy-and-paste the following much longer test. What two numbers are printed at the end? Enter the two numbers, separated only by spaces.

my_account = BankAccount(10)
my_account.withdraw(5)
my_account.deposit(10)
my_account.withdraw(5)
my_account.withdraw(15)
my_account.deposit(20)
