"""
Create a program that simulates the classic game Hangman. Hangman is a word guessing game in which you have a certain number of guesses to guess a secret word. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. When a correct letter is guessed the letter is revealed. When all of the letters are revealed before the number of guesses has been exhausted then the player wins.
