"""
Create a simulation of the Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock game. See the video below:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSLeBKT7-sM

Rules of the game in detail:
Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock
#sissors > paper
#Paper > rock
#Rock > lizard
#Lizard > Spock
#Spock > Sissors
#Sissors > lizard
#Lizard > paper
#Paper > Spock
#Spock > rock
#rock > sissors

Create a "player" variable and let that represent the players choice, picking one of the 5 choices and the computer randomly picks one of the 5, and have python compare the choices. Then have python print to the logs the results, telling whether the player won lost or tied.
