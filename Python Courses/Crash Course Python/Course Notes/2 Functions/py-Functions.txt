Practice Problem: Create a function that simulates a "Magic 8 ball". The idea is the function will give you a random fortune every time it's called. (A random fortune like: "You will be very rich" or "Yes it will happen")
 
 Answer:
 
import random

def eightBall():
  
  fortuneList = ["It certainly will happen", "You can count on it", "Busy now ask me later", "Doubtful", "Sorry not a chance"]
  
  fortune = fortuneList[random.randrange(0,5)]
  
  return fortune

print(eightBall())
