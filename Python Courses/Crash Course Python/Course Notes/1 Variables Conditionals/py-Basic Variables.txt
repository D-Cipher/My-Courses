#Programming Fundementals: Basic Variables

#=======Basic Variables: String, Bool, Int, Float=======

#A variable is a store of information
#Python is a High-level language - it uses language that is more like human language which is then translated to machine language through an interperter or compiler for the computer to understand. ASCII-code: Bit Patterns -> High level to low level converstion.

countryName = "United States"

countryCode = "111"

numSongs = 100

numGrams = 20.0

favoriteSong = True

testType = type(numGrams)

numSongs = numSongs + 1

numSongs += 1

countryCode = countryCode + "5"

#Basic Math and Conversions

numGramsHalf = numGrams / 2

numGramsDoubled = numGrams * 2

numSongsModulo = numSongs % 2

currentSong = "the current song is: " + str(numSongs)

#Note: Python variables are weakly typed meaning the variable type does not need to be declared. Other languages like C you must declare the type (so called strongly typed)

Practice Problem: Tax Machine calculates the tax on an item. Create a variable "price" as an Int and a "tax rate" as a Float and multiply them together and convert the result into a String that reads:
The tax is: (answer)

Answer:

price = 20
tax_rate = .05
prefix = "The tax is: "
tax = float(price)*tax_rate
answer = prefix + "$" + str(totalPrice)
print(answer)
