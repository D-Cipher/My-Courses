#Programming Fundementals: Functions

Integrated development environment (IDE) -> a tool where you both write code and it compiles the code for you and allows you to debug it. IDEs usually combine code editors, debuggers, and built-in tools for compiling and running applications. They can be virtual or installed on your machines.

Interpreter vs Compiler -> Interpreter directly executes the instructions in the source programming language. Compiler scans the entire program and then translates the whole program into machine code.

#====Functions====

#Note: Languages fall on this spectrum: Procedual -- Functional -- Object-Oriented

import random

#A function can have no inputs
def dice():
    diceRoll = random.randrange(1,7)
    return diceRoll

print(dice())

#A function with one input
def payrate(hourPay):
  result = hourPay*8
  return result
  
print(payrate(50))

#A function can have multiple inputs
def radioDisplay(songName, artist):
  output = "Up next: " + songName + ", by " + artist
  return output

print(radioDisplay("Hello", "Adel"))

#Input allows you to input the value of your variable.
name = input()
print(name)

#Function that simulates the matrix scene.
def matrix():
  print("Wake up,")
  print("your name...")
  name = input()
  print("The Matrix has you.")
  print("Follow the white rabbit.")
  response = input()
  knock = "Knock, knock... " + name + "."
  print(knock)
  
matrix()
