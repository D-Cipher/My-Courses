Write a function add_vector(vList,wList), that takes two lists of equal length and adds each item in the list to the item in the corresponding list, and then creates a new list of the sums. For instance, the first item of vList should be added to the first item of wList.Remember that each item's addition should be performed independently on each corresponding element of the lists. Hint: returning v + w does not work

Write a function day_to_number(day) that uses the day_list = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"] and returns the position of the given day in that list. Write a for loop to implement this function, then look up and use the Python list method that can perform this.
