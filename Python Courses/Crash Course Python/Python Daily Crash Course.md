## Python Daily: Python Crash Course I

### About this Course
Welcome to Python Crash Course I! In this course we will learn about the fundamentals of programming with the Python language. Together, we will build various programs and games. This course is for absolute beginners, no coding experience needed.

The goal of this course is to develop a strong foundation in programming within a short amount of time. Further, we will immediately apply the skills we have developed to projects. The idea is to be able to use the skills from the course in our daily jobs and projects to increase our productivity, efficiency, and/or quality.

Further, the knowledge we will gain in this class can be applied to other modern programming languages. Whether you want to use programming to build software, develop websites, manage networks, or perform big-data analytics, they all start with the foundational skills that we will hone in this class.

A word of warning: no one can learn how to program in five sections. The learning process really comes in between each lecture, when we are sitting at home doing the practice problems and/or building the projects of this course. This is when we start applying the concepts introduced in the lectures. Hence, the projects are designed to be difficult and it is through the struggle of figuring them out that we can accelerate the learning process.

Without further delay, let’s learn the fundamentals, let’s get some hands-on experience, and most importantly let’s have a lot of fun in the process!
