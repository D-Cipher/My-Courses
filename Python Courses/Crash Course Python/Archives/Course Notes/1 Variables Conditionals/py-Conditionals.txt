Practice Problem: Your programming teacher has decided he's going to write a program that will give you praise you if you get a good grade and ridicule you if you get bad grades. If you get an "A" in the class you will recieve an "Excellent I'm proud of you".  If you get a "B" in the class you will get a "Above average". If you get a "C" in the class you will get a "I am disappointed." If you get anything less than a "C" you will get a "You need to retake the class." Create this program for your teacher to get on his good side.

Answer:

grade = "A"

if grade == "A":
  message = "Excellent I'm proud of you"
elif grade == "B":
  message = "Above average"
elif grade == "C":
  message = "I am disappointed"
else: 
  message = "You need to retake the class"

print(message)
