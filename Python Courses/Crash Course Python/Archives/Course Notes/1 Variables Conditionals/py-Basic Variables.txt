#Programming Fundementals: Basic Variables

# Overview of Programming

#Programming, specifically high-level programming -> is using language that is more like human language which is then translated to machine language through an interperter or compiler for the computer to understand. (example: Python)

#IDE or "Integrated development environment" -> a tool where you both write code and it compiles the code for you and allows you to debug it. IDEs usually combine code editors, debuggers, and built-in tools for compiling and running applications. They can be virtual or installed on your machines.

#Interpreter vs Compiler -> Interpreter directly executes the instructions in the source programming language. Compiler scans the entire program and then translates the whole program into machine code.

#=======Basic Variables: String, Bool, Int, Float=======

#Variable -> A store of information, a piece of data we want the computer to store

# ASCII-code -> Bit patterns that are the conversion between high level to low level. See https://www.ascii-code.com/. When we code we see variables, but the computer actually sees binary bit patterns. Hence in the back end our code is being translated to bits.

countryName = "United States"

countryCode = "111"

numSongs = 100

numGrams = 20.0

favoriteSong = True

testType = type(numGrams)

numSongs = numSongs + 1

numSongs += 1

countryCode = countryCode + "5"

#Basic Math and Conversions

numGramsHalf = numGrams / 2

numGramsDoubled = numGrams * 2

numSongsModulo = numSongs % 2

currentSong = "the current song is: " + str(numSongs)

#Note: Python variables are weakly typed meaning the variable type does not need to be declared. Other languages like C you must declare the type (so called strongly typed)

Practice Problem: Tax Machine calculates the tax on an item. Create a variable "price" as an Int and a "tax rate" as a Float and multiply them together and convert the result into a String that reads:
The tax is: (answer)

Answer:

price = 20
tax_rate = .05
prefix = "The tax is: "
tax = float(price)*tax_rate
answer = prefix + "$" + str(totalPrice)
print(answer)
