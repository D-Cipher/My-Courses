Whooh Hi Everybody!

We are hosting another crash course on iOS app development! In this course we will learn about the Xcode environment and the Swift language by building a fully deployable app together. This course is for beginners, no coding experience needed.

We can do almost anything when we work together with our friends! So we are gonna make new friends and work together to build a simple version of the iPhone music player app.

What you we will learn
