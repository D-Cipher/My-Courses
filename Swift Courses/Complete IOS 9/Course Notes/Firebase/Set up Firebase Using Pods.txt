###Initialize CocoaPods in Xcode Project

Make sure your xcode project is closed, then run following:
'''
$ cd my-project-directory
$ pod init
$ open -a Xcode Podfile 
'''

Change Pod file:
-Uncomment and change "platform :ios, '8.0'" to "platform :ios, '9.0'"
-Uncomment "user_frameworks!"
-Add the following after "target ... do":
'''
pod 'Firebase', '>= 2.5.1'
'''

Save, close, then run the command:
'''
$ pod install
$ open my-project.xcworkspace
'''

###Import Firebase into App

Create a Bridging Header
-Click on the "my-project" xcode file
-File>New File>Cocoa Touch Class

-Subclass of: NSObject
-Language: Objective-C
-Note: Make sure there is a popup that asks whether to create with Bridging Header, and you want to click "Create Bridging Header". 
-delete the "delete.h" and "delete.m" files.

Change Bridging Header file
In the bridging header file add the following:
'''
