CloudFront

CloudFront -> Web level caching. CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) distributed servers that that deliver webpages to user based on geographic location of the user, orgin of the webpage, and content delivery server.
- Speeds up delivery of content
- Can be used for static and dynamic content
- Orgins: S3, EC2, ELB, HTTP servers
- Protect private content (SSL)
- Integrates with: Shield Standar/Advanced, WAF

Edge location -> location where content is cached. Caching is triggered by the first user to request access.
- Time To Live (TTL) -> Duration objects are cached, after the time is up then object in cache will be deleted.
- Invalidation -> you can invalidate cached objects, important when adding new data, but there is a charge.

Orgin -> orgin of the files that will be distributed 

Distribution -> collection of edge locations
- Web Distribution -> type of distribution used for websites
- RTMP -> type of distribution used for media streaming

Cost Benefits:
- No data transfer between S3 and CloudFront
- Reduces compute workload for EC2 instances

Cost Considerations:
1) Traffic distribution (how wide)
2) Number of requests
3) Data transfer out
4) Clearing Caches
