Stateless vs Stateful

1) Stateful Web Servers -> stores the client state into the server.
- Stores the state, don't need to make multiple calls to the DB
- Problem is does not scale horizontally because it stores in one particular server, but with new server it will not have the stored state.
- Works well with one server.

2) Stateless Web Servers -> does not store client state into the server, rather shares a TOKEN with the client and client uses the token to login.
- Persisted store -> server takes the token and queries the database for varification.
- Need to call the database each time.
- Allows for scaling horizontally, works well with multiple servers.
