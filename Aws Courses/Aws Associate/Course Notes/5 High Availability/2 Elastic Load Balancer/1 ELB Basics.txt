Elastic Load Balancer 

Elastic Load Balancer -> Distributes the load of traffic across multiple instances.
- Monitors health of targets and only routes traffic to healthy ones.
- 60 seconds default idle time.
- Cannot set up ELB to serve instances across regions, only across AZs.
- ELBs managed by Security Groups.

Advantages:
- Cache results to improve performance
- Can be used to store session state data

ELB Requirements:
- Require ONE public subnet in EACH AZ you want ELB.
- Internet facing ELBs require public IP.
- If your ELB not distributing traffic to instances in an AZ its likely it does not have a public subnet
- Recommend TWO public subnets in AZ you want ELB.

Load Balancer States -> provisioning, active, failed

Slow Start Mode -> Gives targets time to warm up before sending traffic.

Connection Draining -> Specify how long to keep connection alive before reporting the instance as de-registered. 
- Enabled by default at 300 seconds, can set up to 3,600 seconds.
- "InService: Instance deregistration currently in progress" error if connection draining 

504 Error -> Gateway has timed out, application not responding, look at the web server layer or db layer.
