Path Patterns

Path Patterns -> Path conditions to send traffic based on the pattern of the URL contained in the request.
- You can create a listener to create rules to forward requests based on the URL path. 
- Example 1: you can route general requests to one target group and requests to render images to another target group.
- Example 2: "/api/android" are forwarded to an auto scaling group called "Android-Target-Group" while "/api/ios" are forwarded to a different auto scaling group called "iOS-Target-Group".
