Sticky Sessions

Sticky Sessions -> Bind a user session to a particular EC2 instance. This allows each request from that user to be sent to the same instance.
- Uses cookies to bound client to backend instance for duration of cookie life.
- If you find that all traffic from a user is being routed to one instance from your ELB then you should disable sticky sessions.

Application Load Balancers:
- Sticky sessions can be enabled but are sent at the target group level.
- Supports load balancer generated cookies only.
- Does not support application generated cookies.
- Cookie named AWSALB.

Classic Load Balancers:
- Each request is independently registered to EC2 instance with the smallest load.
