ELB Setup Process

ELB Setup Process -> You can set up your load balancer in EC2-Classic to distribute incoming requests across EC2 instances in a single AZ or multiple AZs.
- By default, the load balancer routes traffic evenly across AZs.
- Cross-Zone Load Balancing -> Lets you change this so that load balancer routes traffic evenly across all available instances rather AZs by using.

Process:
1) Launch EC2 instances in all the AZs that you plan to use. 
2) Register these instances with your load balancer. 
3) Add each AZ to your load balancer. 
4) Load balancer will start routing requests to the registered instances in the AZs. Modify the AZs for your load balancer at any time.
