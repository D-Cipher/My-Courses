ELB Security Features

Perfect Forward Secrecy -> provides safeguards against the eavesdropping of encrypted data, through the use of a unique random session key. This prevents the decoding of captured data, even if the secret long-term key is compromised. 
- Available for ELBs and CloudFront

Server Order Preference -> configure the load balancer to enforce cipher ordering, providing more control over the level of security used by clients to connect with your load balancer.

Predefined Security Policy -> simplifies the configuration of your load balancer by providing a recommended cipher suite that adheres to AWS security best practices. 
- TLS 1.1 and 1.2
- Offers high security ciphers such as those used for Elliptic Curve signatures and key exchanges

Server Name Indication (SNI) -> Extenstion that allows the client to connect to hostnames, supports multiple secure websites using a single listener
- Host-based routing allows you to route multiple domains to same ELB
- Allows binding multiple SSL certificates to the listener

SSL Negotiations between ELB and Client:
- ELB Predefined security policies
- Use custom security policies: Ciphers and protocols (only for CLB)
