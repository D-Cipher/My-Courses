Termination Policy

Auto Scaling Group decides how to terminate instances based on the following:
1) Are there instances in multiple AZs
 a) Select the AZ with the most instnaces
 b) Select the instance with the oldest launch configurations
2) Are there multiple instances with the oldest launch configurations?
 a) Select the instance with the closest to the next billing hour
3) Are there multiple instances with the closes billing hour?
 a) Randomly select between these instances
4) Terminate instance.

Misconception: ASG does not terminate the instance that has been running the longest

ASG sending SNS -> can be configured to send SNS when:
- Instance is launched
- Instance is terminated
- Instance fails to launch
- Instance fails to terminate
