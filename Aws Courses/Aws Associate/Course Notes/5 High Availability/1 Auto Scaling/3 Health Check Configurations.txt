Health Check Configurations

Health Checks -> Application Load Balancer periodically sends requrest to its registeered targests to test their status.
- ELB only routes requests to healthy targets
- Often times if instances are out of service from the load balancer the reason is Health Check configuration are not properly defined.

Health Check States:
- Initial -> LB registering health check
- Healthy -> Target is healthy
- Unhealthy -> Target did not respond or failed
- Unused -> Target not registered with target group or group is not using listener rule
- Draining -> Target is deregistering

Health Check Types:
- HTTP and HTTPS -> offered in Application Load Balancers
- TCP -> offered in Network Load Balancers

Termination of unhealthy instances:
1) If connection draining, Auto Scaling waits for in-flight requests
2) Terminates unhealthy instances before launching replacement

Standby State -> Instances in standby state is still managed by ASG and are counted as normal, but do not count towards workload. 
- Does not perform health check on standbys
- Great for performing updates and troubleshooting on the instance without impacting the ASG
