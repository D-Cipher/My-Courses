Auto Scaling

Auto Scaling -> service allows for scalable resources, used for applications that experience variable load.
- Scale applications based on resource tags or AWS CloudFormation stacks. 
- Create scaling plan. Define how each of the resources in your application should be scaled. 
- Create target track scaling policy. AG keeps scale at target value based scaling strategy.
- Auto Scaling is free to use.
- Allows for graceful failure where the impact of failure is reduced by launching replacement instances.

Rebalancing -> Auto Scaling will try to rebalance instances across AZs. It will launch in AZ with fewer instances before terminating in AZ with more instances to rebalance.

Predefined Strategies
1) optimize availability
2) optimize costs
3) balance the two. 

Custom strategy -> define your target values, set the min/max values for the resources.

Useful for variations in traffic flow:
1) Cyclical traffic -> high business hours and low overnight hours
2) On/off workloads -> batch processing, testing, periodic analysis
3) Variable traffic -> marketing campaigns, periods of spiky growth
