Scaling Events

How it works:
- Install CloudWatch Monitoring Scripts in your EC2 instances to collect and monitor the custom metric (memory usage), which will be used by your Auto Scaling Group as a trigger for scaling.
- ELB balances the load across our instances
- CloudWatch monitors the instances' health
- CloudWatch sends an alarm if CPU utilization level is exceeded
- Auto Scaling Policy intercepts the alarm and determines how many instances to launch and what kind of instance it should be.

Monitoring -> CloudWatch lets the ASG know when to scale in and when to scale out.
- CloudWatch monitors: CPU utilization, Network metrics, Queue Size
- CloudWatch Logs -> stores the data
- Provides default and custom metrics

Load Balancing -> Elastic Load Balancer distributes traffic across the instances.
- Each time ASG creates an instance it will register it with the ELB.
