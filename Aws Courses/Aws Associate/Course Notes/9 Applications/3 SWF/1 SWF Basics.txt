Simple Work Flow (SWF) -> way of coordinating work across distributed application components. Designed as a coordination of tasks tool. 
- Combine digital environment with human actions. 
- Executions last up to 1 year
- Task-oriented API

- keeps track of all tasks and events in an application
- SWF uses long polling
- Ensures that a task is never duplicated and is assigned only once. 
- Enable you to coordinate your workflow without worrying about duplicate, lost, or conflicting tasks.

Domain -> a collection of related workflows

SWF process:
1) Workflow starters -> initiates the workflow execution
2) Activity Task -> tells the activity worker to perform a function
3) Decision Task -> tells the decider the state of the workflow so the decider can determine the next activity.
4) Deciders -> Control flow of activities.
5) Activity Workers -> Carry out activity tasks.
