Internet Gatway

Internet Gateway -> Horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available instance attached to VPC that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.
- Attach an internet gateway to your VPC.
- Ensure that your subnet route table points to the internet gateway.
- Ensure that instances has public IP address (public IPv4 address, Elastic IP address, or IPv6 address).
- Ensure that your network access control and security group rules allow the internet traffic.

Egress-Only Internet Gateway -> Allows IPv6 based traffic within a VPC to access the Internet, while denying any Internet based resources the possibility of initiating a connection back into the VPC.
