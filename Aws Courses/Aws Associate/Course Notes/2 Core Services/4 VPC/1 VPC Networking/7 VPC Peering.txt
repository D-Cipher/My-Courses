VPC Peering

VPC Peering -> Allows you to connect one VPC with another via direct network route using a private IP address.
- Instances behave as if they were on the same private network
- You can peer VPC with other AWS account VPCs
- You can peer across regions
- Peering is in a star configuration, meaning 1 central VPC peered with 4 others.
- Triangle peering is allowed -> peering in a triangle configuration.

Unicast IP routing -> VPC only allows one-to-one distribution of data, does not support multicast network capabilities.
- You can overlay a multicast network by building IP level multicast across a network of unicast instances at the OS level

VPC Peering DO NOT support:
1) TRANSITIVE peering -> Cannot have one VPC talk to another VPC through a third VPC that they are both peered to.
2) Overlapping CIDR Blocks -> Cannot peer two VPCs with the same CIDR blocks or blocks that have overlapping addresses.
3) Edge-to-Edge Routing through a gateway or VPN -> A VPC cannot access any gateways of the VPC that it is peered to.

VPC Peering Across Regions:
1) Data sent between regions are encrypted
2) Update the route tables to enable IP connectivity
3) Update the security group to allow resource sharing
4) Use mesh topology to allow all VPCs to communicate with each other
