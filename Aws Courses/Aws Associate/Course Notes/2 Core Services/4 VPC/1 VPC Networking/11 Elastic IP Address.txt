Elastic IP Address

Elastic IP Address (EIP) -> A static public IPv4 address designed for cloud computing.
- You must specify an elastic IP address in order to associate the instance with a NAT Gateway.
- You can mask the failure of an instance or software by quickly re-mapping the address to another instance in your account.
- Currently do not support Elastic IP for IPv6
- Elastic IP remains associated with your AWS account until you explicitly release them.
- Elastic IP remains associated with your instance even when it is stopped and then started again.
- Limited to five Elastic IP addresses

Typical reason EC2 cannot access internet:
1) Instance does not have an EIP or a public IP address.
2) Route table is not configured properly.

EIP does not incur a charge if:
1) EIP is associated with a running EC2 instance.
2) The EC2 instance only has one EIP attached.
