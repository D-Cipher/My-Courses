Route Tables

Route Tables -> Set of rules called routes that are used to determine where network traffic is directed to.
- VPC comes with one main route table pre-configured.
- One subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time. 
- Multiple subnets can be associated with the same route table.
- Cannot delete the main route table, but you can replace it.
- Must update the route table of any subnet that you want to use a gateway.
- Longest prefix match -> used to select the most specific route across the intended VPC peering connection.
