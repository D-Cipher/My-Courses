Network ACL

Network Access Control List -> Numbered list of rules controlling access to subnets
- Evaluated in CRONOLOGICAL order from lowest to highest.
- Always evaluated before security groups
- VPCs come with a network ACL and by default allows all outbound and inbound traffic.
- All VPCs must be associated with a network ACL. If none then it will associate with the default
- Block IP addresses using network ACLs
- Subnet can only be associated with one network ACL but network ACL can have multiple subnets.
- Network ACLs are stateless -> seperate inbound and outbound rules, responses to inbound traffic are subject to rules of outbound (vice versa)

Stateless -> Network ACLs are stateless responses to allow inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa)
- You have explicitly add both an Inbound and Outbound rule

Network ACL Evaluation:
1) Lowest numbered rule will be evaluated first, ex: rule 100
2) If there is no match then it will go to the next rule, ex: rule: 200.
3) If there is a match then it will stop and not evaluate any other rules.

Example Evaluation:
```
Rule: 99; Port: 80; Source: 172.30.19.12/32; Deny
Rule: 100; Port: 80; Source: 0.0.0.0/0; Allow
Rule: 199; Port: 20; Source: 172.30.19.12/32; Deny
Rule: 200; Port 22; Source: 0.0.0.0/0; Allow
```
