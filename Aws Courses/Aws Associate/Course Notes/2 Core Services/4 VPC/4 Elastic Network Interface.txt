Elastic Network Interface

Elastic Network Interface (ENI) (eth1) -> Attachable virtual network card that allows network traffic to be redirected from one instance to another when attached to the instance.
- Once attached the ENI will remain attached even if the EC2 instance is stopped and restarted. 
- Persist even if the instance is terminated

Primary Network Interface (eth0) -> Default ENI that is attached to every instance in a VPC. 
- You cannot detach or modify.
- The maximum number of network interfaces that you can use varies by instance type.
- Terminated if the instance is terminated.

Types of Attach
1) Hot attach -> Attaching while instance is running.
2) Warm attach -> Attaching while instance is stopped. 
3) Cold attach -> Attaching while instance is being launched.
