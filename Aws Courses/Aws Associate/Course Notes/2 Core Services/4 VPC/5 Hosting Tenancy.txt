Hosting Tenancy

Hosting Tenancy -> Tenancy ensures all EC2 instances that are launched in a VPC run on a particular tenancy attribute whether default or dedicated configuration. 

Tenancy attribute
1) Default -> Your instance runs on shared hardware.
2) Dedicated -> Your instance runs on single-tenant hardware.
3) Host -> Your instance runs on a Dedicated Host, which is an isolated server with configurations that you can control.

Dedicated Hosts -> Physical EC2 dedicated for your use, paid by the hour.
- Good for regulatory requirements where not allowed for multi-tenant virtualization.
- Good for licensing requirements 
- Can be purchased On-Demand
- Can be purchased as reserved

Note:
- You cannot change the tenancy of an instance from default to dedicated/host after you've launched it and vice versa.
- You can change the tenancy attribute of your VPC from dedicated to default using the AWS CLI/SDK. 
- You cannot change the VPC from default to dedicated though.  
- You can transition between Dedicated and Host by stopping and starting the instance.
