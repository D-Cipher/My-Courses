Glacier

Glacier -> Data archiving retrieval times are configurable from minutes to hours. 

Deep Archive -> Lowest cost storage but retrieval is 12 hours.

Vault Lock -> Glacier vaults can have one resource-based vault access policy and one Vault Lock policy attached to it.
- Vault Lock policy -> access policy can help you enforce regulatory and compliance requirements
- After locking the policy the policy becomes immutable

Using Glacier Tiers:
- You cannot upload data directly to Glacier, you must set a lifecycle policy or use the API or CLI
- You can upload data to S3 and set the lifecycle policy to transition data to Glacer after 0 days for immediate transition
- Retrieved data is avaliable for 24 hours by default
- Glacier must complete a job before you get the output
- Data encrypted by default at rest
- Retrieved data will not be encrypted if upload was unencrypted
- Deleting within 90 days will be charged
