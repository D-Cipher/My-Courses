S3 Uploads Downloads

Consistency Model:
1) Uploads are Synchronous -> Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects. You can immediately read after uploading.
2) Downloads / Deletes / Overwrites are Asynchronous -> Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES, if your delete or overwrite it changes may take alittle longer than immediate. Does not always return the most up-to-date data.

File Uploads:
1) Single-part Upload -> Single PUT operations can upload up to 5 GBs.
2) Multipart Upload API -> Using the multi-part upload API, you can upload large objects, up to 5 TB.
- Routine that allows uploading a single object as a set of parts instead of all at once. 
- After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 then presents the data as a single object.
- Pause and resume object uploads
- Begin an upload before you know the final object size
- Delivers improved throughput
- Quick recovery from network issues

S3 Parallel Requests:
S3 supports Parallel Requests -> automatically scales to high request rates to increase performance
- 3,500 PUT / COPY / POST / DELETE and 5,500 GET / HEAD requests per second per prefix in a bucket.
- S3 automatically manages performance at this scale.
- No limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket.
