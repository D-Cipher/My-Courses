S3 Storage Tiers 

Standar Tier
- S3 Standard -> durable, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain losses of 2 facilities concurrently.

Infrequently Accessed Tiers
- S3 IA -> S3 Infrequently Accessed, Infrequently Accessed but requires rapid access when needed, lower fee but charged fee when access.
- S3 One Zone IA -> Lower cost option, only stored in one AZ.
- S3 Intelligent Tiering -> Designed to optimize costs by moving objects to different tiers.

Glacier Tiers
- Glacier -> Data archiving retrieval times are configurable from minutes to hours. 
- Glacier Deep Archive -> Lowest cost storage but retrieval is 12 hours.

Comparing Standard, IA, and Glacier tiers:
- Standard is more expensive to store, but cheaper to retrieve.
- IA is cheaper to store, but more expensive to retrieve. 
- IA minimum life cycle transition is 30 days.
- Glacier minimum life cycle transition is 0 days.
- Glacier tiers ENCRYPT data by DEFAULT.

S3 Storage Cost Considerations:
1) Storage class
2) Storage amount
3) Requests
4) Data transfers
