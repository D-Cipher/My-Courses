Storage Gateway Interfaces

Supports three storage interfaces: file, volume, tape.
1) File gateway -> object storage that stores files in S3. 
- NFS or SMB protocols 
- Objects written through file gateway can be directly access in S3.

2) Volume Gateway -> block stroage that stores hard disk drive volumes in S3. 
- Uses iSCSI protocol to stored volumes. (iSCSV)
- To access iSCSI volumes you can take EBS snapshot and create them as EBS volumes.

3) Tape Gateway (VTL) -> Virtual tape based backup, use iSCSI virtual tape library (VTL) and stores in S3 or Glacier.
