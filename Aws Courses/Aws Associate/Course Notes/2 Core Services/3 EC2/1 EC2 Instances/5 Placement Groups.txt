EC2 Placement Groups

EC2 Placement Groups are a way of placing your EC2 Instances primarily to improve inter-instance communication. 
- The placement group must be unique within your AWS account.
- There is no charge for creating a placement group. 

Launching Placement Groups
- Recommended that you launch placement group with the number of instances in a single launch request 
- Recommended that all instance are the same type
- Adding more instances to the placement group later is allowed, but increase chances of getting an insufficient capacity error due to not syncing properly. 
- Stop and start all of the instances in the placement group and launching again should clear the issue

There are three types:
1) Clustered Placement Groups -> Grouping of instances within a single AZ. 
- Used for apps for low latency and high throughput. 
- Put Instances very close to each other for low network latency.
- Deploying instances in a single Availability Zone is unique to Cluster Placement Groups.

2) Spread Placement Group -> Grouping of instances on distinct underlying hardware, each instance is on its own rack and power source. 
- Used for apps that have small number of critical instances that should be kept seperate from each other. 
- Prevent hardware failure.
- Spread placement groups can only have 7 running instances per AZ.
- Minimize the traffic concentration to avoiding bottlenecks and improve fault-tolerance.

3) Partitioned Placement Groups -> Divides each group into logical segmants called partitioned. Each partition is on it's own racks and power source.
