EC2 Basics

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - web service provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. A computer in the cloud.
- 20 On-Demand instances per region
- 200 TB of aggregated PIOPS volumes per region

Main Types of EC2 Instances:

1) General Purpose -> All around instances that provide balance of compute, memory, and networking.

2) Storage Optimized -> High sequential read and write databases, data warehouses, and file servers. Also able to deliver on low-latency and IOPS intensive workloads.

3) Compute Optimized -> High-performance processors for CPU intensive apps, CPU intensive dbs, graphics, and media transcoding.

4) Memory Intensive -> RAM intensive, in memory data processing workloads. For example: Apache, SAP, Spark.
