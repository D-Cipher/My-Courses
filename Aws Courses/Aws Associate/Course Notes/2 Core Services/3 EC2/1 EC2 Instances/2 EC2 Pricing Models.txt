EC2 Pricing Models

Pricing Models:
1) On Demand -> pay fixed rate by the hour with no commitment
2) Spot Pricing -> Bid for a price you want for the capacity
3) Reserved Pricing -> capacity reservation for 1 to 3 year terms. Reserved instances cannot be moved between regions.
4) Dedicated Hosts -> Physical EC2 dedicated for your use, paid by the hour.
5) Dedicated Instances -> Instances run on hardware dedicated to single customer. Automatic instance placement and billing per instance.

EC2 Billing works as follows:
- Billed in the running state.
- Billed in the stopping state when preparing to hibernate.
- EBS Volumes attached to stopped EC2 Instances.
- Not billed in the pending state.
- Not billed in the preparing to stop state.
- Not billed in the stop state.
- Not billed in terminated state UNLESS it is a reserved instance that has not reached end of the reserved term.

EC2 Compute Cost Considerations:
1) Clock hours of server time
2) Machine configurations
3) Machine purchase type
4) Number of instances
5) Load balancing
6) Detailed monitoring
7) Auto Scaling
8) Elastic IP addresses
9) Operating systems and software packages
