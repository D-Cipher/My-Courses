Enhanced Networking

Enhanced networking -> Uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported instance types. 

SR-IOV -> A method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization when compared to traditional virtualized network interfaces. 

Advantages:
1) Higher Network performance, higher packet per second (PPS).
2) Higher bandwidth
3) Consistently lower inter-instance latencies
4) No additional charge for using enhanced networking.
