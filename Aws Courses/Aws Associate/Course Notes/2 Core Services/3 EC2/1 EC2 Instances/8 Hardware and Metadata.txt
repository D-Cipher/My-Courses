Hardware and Metadata

Hypervisor -> hardware virtualization technique that allows multiple operating systems (OS) to run on a single host system at the same time.
- Underlying Hypervision for EC2 is Xen but AWS recently added Nitro.
- Xen is a hypervisor that enables the simultaneous creation, execution and management of multiple virtual machines on one physical computer.
- Every AWS AMI uses the Xen hypervisor on bare metal. Xen offers two kinds of virtualization: HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) and PV (Paravirtualization).
- A bare metal environment is a computer system or network in which a virtual machine is installed directly on hardware rather than within the host operating system (OS). The term "bare metal" refers to a hard disk, the usual medium on which a computer OS is installed.
- The latest AWS hypervisor, Nitro, uses everything to provide a new hardware-assisted hypervisor that is easy to use and has near bare-metal performance. It's an exciting development in cloud computing: hardware virtualization is now fast.

EC2 Metadata -> Retrieving Instance Metadata
1) Make sure instance security group http and https is opened up to the world.
2) Make sure Apache is installed. See Apache Guide.
3) Use the curl on the IP address 169.254.169.254
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

Instance Metadata Query Tool -> Allows you to query instance metadata without URL
