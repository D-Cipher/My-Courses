EFS

Elastic File System (EFS) -> File storage solution that allows you to create and configure file systems for shared storage.
- Low-latency FILE OPERATION 
- Read-after-write consistency
- Allows concurrent connections from multiple EC2 instances hosted on multiple AZs
- Posix compliant solution
- Supports NFSv4.1 and 4.1 protocol
- Compatable with Linux-based AMIs for EC2

Mount Targets -> EC2 connects to network instances within the VPC that connect to the EFS. Can only connect to one target at a time.

EFS Storage
- Storage capacity is elastic meaning it will grow and shrink based on need. 
- Petabyte-scale file storage
- You only pay for the storage you use. Pay as you go.
- Data stored across multiple AZs
- Can support life-cycle management option for Infrequently Accessed storage.

EFS Max IO mode -> Scale to higher level of aggregated throughput but with slightly higher latency for file operations
