Elastic Container Service

Elastic Container Service (ECS) -> Fully managed cluster platform which allows you to host Docker containers in the cloud.
- Allows you to host containers at scale much better than EC2
- Less management overhead
- Containers can only be created through image templates

ECS Scaling -> Adjust the ECS service desired count up or down in response to load variations.

Elastic Container Registry (ECR) -> Registry service of private Docker repositories.

Varifying Containers:
- Check Docker daemon and container is running on container instance.
- Check container agent is running on the container instance
- Check IAM instance profile has proper permissions
