Encryption

Encrypting on Creation -> When creating an EC2 instance, select the volume and enable encryption
- Root volumes cannot be encrypted once created, must take a snapshot.

Scope of Encryption:
- Data at rest inside the volume are encrypted
- Data moving between volume and instance are encrypted
- Snapshots created from the volume are encrypted
- Volumes created from snapshot are encrypted

Encrypting on Existing Instance or Volume
1) Create a snapshot of the volume
2) Create a copy of the snapshot and select the option to encrypt
3) Create an AMI from the encrypted Snapshot
4) Use the AMI to launch a new encypted instance

Encrypting Root Volume -> You cannot restore snapshot of root volume without downtime, it is better to copy over the data
1) Create a new EBS volume
2) Mount the volume
3) Copy over the data to the new volume
4) Delete the old volume
