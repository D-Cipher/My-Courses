Elastic Block Store (EBS)

EBS -> Elastic Block Store -> Provide lowest-latency access to data, allows you to create storage volumes and attach to EC2 instances.
- Can perform live configuration changes while in production without service interruption.
- Can stripe multiple volumes together to create larger volumes
- Can provision capacity
- Can persist beyond the lifecycle of the EC2 instance
- Data stored on EBS is automatically replicated within an AZ
- You cannot mount 1 EBS to multiple EC2 instances.
- By default termination protection is turned off.
- By default root EBS deleted when instance terminated.

Configurable: volume type, volume size, and IOPS capacity

Volumes -> virtual hard disk that exist on EBS
- Volumes are replicated across multiple servers within an AZ to protect you from component failure.

IOPS -> input output per second
- Max ratio of IOPS to volume size is 50:1 that means for 10 GiB volume you can provision up to 500 IOPS.

EBS Storage Cost Considerations:
1) Volumes Type
2) IOPs Type
3) Snapshot frequency and storage
4) Data transfer across regions
