EBS Snapshots

Snapshots -> Incremental point in time copies of volumes, saved to S3.
- A single snapshot is both incremental and complete
- You do not need to detach your volumes to take snapshots
- When taking a snapshot of ROOT volume you need to stop the instance first

Un-mounting to take snapshot:
- Minimizes application downtime if you need consistent snapshot
- Taking snapshots on running instance may not be consistent

Moving EC2 Instances
In order to move a volume from one az or region to another you have to create a snapshot on the root volume. Then you turn that snapshot into an Image, lauch that image into an AMI, and then you use that AMI to create a new EC2 Instance in a new subnet and the other thing you can do is copy AMI into different regions.

Snapshots on RAID configurations
1) Stop all I/O activity writing to RAID array before creating a snapshot.
2) Flush all caches to the disk.
3) Confirm that the associated EC2 instance is no longer writing to the RAID array by: freezing the file system, unmounting the RAID array, shutting down the EC2 instance.
4) Take a snapshot of each EBS volume in the array.
