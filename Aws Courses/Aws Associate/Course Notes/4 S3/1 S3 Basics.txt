S3 Basics

S3 -> object storage that is secure, durable, highly scalable. Stands for Simple Storage Service. Store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.
- Object-based storage
- data is spread across multiple devices and facilities
- universal namespace, unique globally
- Recieve HTTP 200 when upload is complete
- Objects in S3 are immutable, the only way to change a byte of an object is to replace the whole object
- Objects in S3 are replicated across AZs, but are NOT replicated across all regions.

File Uploads
- Upload objects in a single operation -> Single PUT operations can upload up to 5 GBs
- Multipart Upload API -> Using the multipart upload API, you can upload large objects, up to 5 TB.
- S3 automatically scales to high request rates -> 3,500 PUT / COPY / POST / DELETE and 5,500 GET / HEAD requests per second per prefix in a bucket. No limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket. 

Consistency Model
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects, means you can read immediately after uploading
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES, if your delete or overwrite it changes may take alittle longer than immediate.

S3 Guarantees
- 99.9...(x11)% durability guarantee for all S3 (eleven 9s durability)
- 99.9% availability guarantee for S3 standard
- 99% availability guarantee for S3 Intel, S-IA, One Zone IA
- 99.99% availability design for S3 standard
- 99.9% availability design for S3 Intel, S-IA
- 99.5% availability design for One Zone IA

S3 Features
1) Tiered Storage -> different storage classifications
2) Lifecycle Management -> move objects around to 3) different tiers if object reaches a certain age.
4) Versioning -> set different versions
5) Encryption -> encrypt objects
6) MFA -> require authentication to access if needed
Secure data using -> Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies

S3 Charges based on 
- Amount stored GBs per month
- Number of Requests: Put, Copy, Post, List, Get
- Different tiers charge
- Data Transfer to different region charge
- Transfer Acceleration charge -> transfer files over long distances
- Cross region replication -> when replicating data to different regions
- Free: Transfer into S3, transfer in the same region, and to other services.

S3 Terms
Key -> Simply the name of the object
Value -> data made of sequence of bytes
Version ID -> version of the object, allows multiple versions, and version control
Metadata -> data on data
Subresources -> access control lists and torrents
