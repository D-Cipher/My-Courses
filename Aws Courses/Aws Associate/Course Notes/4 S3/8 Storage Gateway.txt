Storage Gateway

Storage Gateway -> Virtual or Physical Device that allows you to replicate data into AWS. Connects on premise infrastructure to the cloud
- Integrates on-premise applications and workflows with AWS block and object cloud storage. 
- Provides low-latency performance by caching frequently accessed data on premise.

Supports three storage interfaces: file, volume, tape.
1) File gateway -> object storage that stores files in S3. 
- Using file protocols such as NFS. 
- Objects written through file gateway can be directly access in S3.

2) Volume Gateway -> block stroage that stores hard disk drive volumes in S3. 
- Uses iSCSI protocol to stored volumes. 
- Cached volumes where most frequently access data is cached on site. 
- To access iSCSI volumes you can take EBS snapshot and create them as EBS volumes.

3) Tape Gateway -> Virtual tape based backup, use iSCSI virtual tape library (VTL) and stores in S3 or Glacier.

AWS PrivateLink -> uses the AWS network to provide private secure connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications. 
- Billing: each hour VPC endpoint remains provisioned and data processing for GB processed through the endpoint.
