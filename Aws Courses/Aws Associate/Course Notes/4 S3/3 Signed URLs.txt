Signed URLs

Signed URLs -> Way to ensure that users attempting access to files in an S3 bucket can be authorised. You can restrict access based on Signed URLs or Signed Cookies, ex only paid users can access.
- Signed URLs and Signed Cookies are different 
- One method generates URLs and the other generates special cookies but they both require the creation of an application and policy to generate and control these items.

Orgin Access Identity -> Virtual user identity that is used to give the CloudFront distribution permission to fetch a private object from an S3 bucket.
- Only CloudFront can access your S3 bucket and CloudFront distributes the URLs to authorized users.
- Prevents direct access to S3
- No Direct URLs
