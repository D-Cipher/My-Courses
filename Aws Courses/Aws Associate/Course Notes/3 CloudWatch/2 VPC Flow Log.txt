VPC Flow Log -> allows you to capture information about the IP traffic going into and from your VPC. Flow log data is stored in CloudWatch.
- You cannot enable flow logs for VPCs that are peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your account.
- Once created you cannot change a flow log's configuration.
- Traffic generated from contact with Amazon DNS server is not logged.
