DNS Records

Alias -> Route 53 extension to the DNS that let you route traffic to AWS resources and from one record in a hosted zone to another.
- Can create alias record for root domain (example.com)
- Can create alias record for subdomains (portal.example.com)

Zone Apex -> root domain, top node of a DNS namespace.

"A" Record -> Authoritative response from name servers that points NS to an IP address for IPv4. Maps to AWS resources recommended set an Alias.

"AAAA" Record -> Authoritative response from name servers that points NS to an IP address for IPv6.

CNAME -> Similar to Alias, resource record that maps one domain to another domain, but cannot map to root domains, only subdomains.

Resource Mapping:
AWS does not recommend you directly map an "A"/"AAAA" record to an IP address, instead create an alias of the record which allow you to map to specific AWS resource domain or zone apex.

Example Use Case:
1) User connects to the DNS through their browser 
2) Browser connects to the Top Level Domain Server querying it for the authoritative DNS records
3) Top Level Domain Server is going to point it to the NS record.
4) That will then match up with the NS Records server which will give us a Start of Authority (SOA). 
5) Within the SOA that is where it will look up the "A"/"AAAA" record which takes the name and points to an IP address.
6) Alias associated with our "A"/"AAAA" mapped to AWS resources will take the user to those resources.

Other Records:
MX Records -> E-mail records.
PTR Records -> Reverse of an "A" record. Way of looking up a name against an IP address.
