Start of Authority

Start of Authority (SOA) Record -> Base DNS information about the domain. When you buy a domain, SOA stores information about domain including:
- name of the server that supplied the data for the zone
- administrator of the zone
- current version of the data file
- number of seconds of the time-to-live file.

SOA Example:
```
ns-2048.awsdns-64.net. hostmaster.example.com. 1 7200 900 1209600 86400
```

Name Server (NS) Record -> Used for looking up names off of the different domain name servers that are listed and associated with the SOA.
- AWS maintains multiple Name Servers for your domain just in case one TLD goes down you have others to go to.

NS Example:
```
ns-2048.awsdns-64.com
ns-2049.awsdns-65.net
ns-2050.awsdns-66.org
ns-2051.awsdns-67.co.uk
```

Using Route53 for existing domain:
1) Create a Route53 Hosted Zone
2) Set the NS records of the domain to point to Route53 name servers
3) Serve website content (ei: use static website via s3 bucket)
4) Map Route53 Alias record to website endpoint
