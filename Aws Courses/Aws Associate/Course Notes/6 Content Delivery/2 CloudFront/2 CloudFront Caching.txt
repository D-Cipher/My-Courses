CloudFront Caching

CloudFront Caching -> Object is cached by CloudFront once a successful request has been made to the origin. It will remain cached until the time to live has expired

Time To Live (TTL) -> Duration objects are cached, after the time is up then object in cache will be deleted.

Cache-Control and Expires headers -> Allows you to control how long objects stay in the cache. 

Cache-Control max-age -> Lets you specify max time of expiration.
- Minimum of 0 seconds for web distributions
- Minimum of 3600 seconds for RTMP distributions

Invalidation -> You can invalidate cached objects when adding new data, but there is a charge and not recommended.

Versioned Objects -> Give objects versioned file names to control which file a request returns even if the user has a version cached. AWS recommends this if file updates are frequent.
- CloudFront access logs includes file names
- Can serve several different file versions to users
