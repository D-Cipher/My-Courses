CloudFront Origins

Origin -> origin of the files that will be distributed 

CloudFront can use various origins:
1) S3 buckets -> place objects in S3 that you want Cloudfront to deliever or configure bucket as website endpoints for your origin
2) Media store or Media package -> MediaStore container or MediaPackage for streaming video
3) EC2 -> custom origin using HTTP server
4) CloudFront Origin Group for Failover -> used for origin failover to designate primary origin and secondary origin that CloudFront automatically switches to when primary origin returns failed HTTP status code.
