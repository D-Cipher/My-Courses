Docker

Docker -> Open source technology that allows you to create applications on top of containers.

Container -> executable software package that contains application, runtime, libraries running on the engine on top of OS. 
- Provides the isolation of virtualization like virtual machines but more light weight.
- Containers share an operating system so they don't need to run their own set of Operating System.
