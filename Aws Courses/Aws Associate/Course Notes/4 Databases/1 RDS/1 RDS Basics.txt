RDS Basics

RDS -> Relational Database Service
- Used for complex transactions or complex queries
- Used for medium to high query / write rate
- Used when you only need a single worker node
- High durability
- Provisioned IOPS -> used for optimizing online transaction processing
- Error Node -> used to check RDS for an error shown in the response from the Amazon RDS API.

Read-after-write Consistency -> Will always return the most up-to-date data.

Database Engines -> MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle,  Maria, and Aurora
- Note that besides Aurora the other RDS are NOT cloud based.

Storage types -> Magnetic, General Purpose (SSD), and Provisioned IOPS

IAM DB Authentication -> You can authentication your db instances using IAM.
- Credentials to the database are managed by IAM
- You do not need a password to connect to the db, instead you can use authentication token
- Compatible for MySQL and PostgreSQL
