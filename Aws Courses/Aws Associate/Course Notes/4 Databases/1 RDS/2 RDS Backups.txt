- Will take a full daily snapshot. Allows you to do a point in time recovery down to the day. 
- Free S3 storage space equal to db size used for backup. 
- Backups are taking in define window and storage may be suspended while data is being backed up.
- Will be deleted after RDS is deleted
- You can make backup window take effect immediately
- Backup retention can be set from 1 day to 35 days

2) Database Snapshots -> taken manually, stored even if after you delete the original RDS.
- Restoring the backup it will restore to a new RDS instance with a new DNS endpoint.

- Use InnoDB as storage engine
- Partition larger tables so size does not exeed 16TB.
- MyISAM storage engine is not recommended
