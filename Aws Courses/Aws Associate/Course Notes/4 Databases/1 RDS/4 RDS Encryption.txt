RDS Encryption

Encryption -> RDS support encryption at rest with KMS and by enabling the encryption option.
- You CANNOT encrypt existing DB, must create a new db via a snapshot.

Enabling encryption also encrypts:
- Automated backups
- Snapshots
- Read Replicas 

Encrypting Read Replicas:
1) Replicas in same region as DB use the same key
2) Replicas in different region as DB use different key
3) Cannot have unencrypted replica of an encrypted DB and vice versa

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt connections between your client applications and RDS Microsoft SQL Server
- When you create a SQL Server DB instance, RDS creates an SSL certificate for it
- SSL certificate includes the DB instance endpoint as the Common Name (CN) for the SSL certificate to guard against spoofing attacks
- IAM database authentication is not compatible with Microsoft SQL Server

Ways of using SSL to connect:

1) Force SSL for all connections —> this happens transparently to the client, and the client does not have to do any work to use SSL
- Set rds.force_ssl parameter to true

2) Encrypt specific connections —> this sets up an SSL connection from a specific client computer, and you must do work on the client to encrypt connections
