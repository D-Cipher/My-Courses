Read Replicas

Read Replicas -> Improves performance, allows you to have a read only copy of your production database to off load some of the reads from your master db.
- Reduce the load on your source DB instance by routing read queries from your applications to the Read Replica.
- Every time your DNS writes to primary, RDS will asynchronously replicate to the read replicas.
- Provides elasticity to the database allowing it to scale out beyond the constraints of the DB.
- Available for all RDS (MySQL, PostreSQL, Oracle, Maria, Aurora) EXCEPT for Microsoft SQL Server.
- Asynchronous replication

Replica Features
- Can have up to 5 replicas (Aurora can have 15).
- Each replica has a DNS endpoint.
- You can have replicas of replicas but latency issues.
- Read replicas can be in different AZs or regions.
- No charge for transfering data when replicating instance.

Replication Method
1) Logical Replication -> Row-by-row replication of the data. 
- MySQL and Maria
- Can be made writable since it's a logical replication
2) Physical Replication -> Block level replication of the database. 
- Oracle and PostgreSQL
- Cannot be made writable except by promoting the replica.

Backup Options
- Must have automatic backups turned on in order to access Read Replicas.
- Automated Backups can be enabled for MySQL and Maria, but not for Oracle and PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL allows for manual snapshots.
- Parallel replication is supported for MySQL, Maria, and Oracle. Not supported for PostgreSQL which can only handle single process replication.

Disaster Recovery
- No automatic failover. Losing the primary, you would need to manually point DNS to secondary.
- Replicas can be promoted to the primary database, this breaks the replication.
- Read replicas can be Multi-AZ and you can create read replica of a multi-az source db.
