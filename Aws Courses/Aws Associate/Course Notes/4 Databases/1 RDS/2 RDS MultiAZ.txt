Multi-AZ

Multi-AZ -> Disaster recovery focused, if DNS loses connection to primary db then amazon will point CNAME to secondary db.
- Synchronous replication in a different AZ.
- You cannot use the standby instance for read/write operations, it is for disaster recovery only.

Automatic Fail-over -> In DR, RDS simply points the CNAME of the database to the secondary database promoting it to become the new primary.
- Protect against service disruptions in cases of system upgrades on OS patching or DB instance scaling.

Simulated Fail-over -> You can simulate a failover by rebooting your DB instances and clicking on reboot with failover.
- You can move DB to a new region using Multi-AZ by forcing a failover by rebooting the RDS instance.

Feature Available
- Available for: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Maria.
- Microsoft SQL Server has Database Mirroring (DBM) for DR.
- Aurora is automatically fault tolerant.

Single-AZ to Multi-AZ -> RDS takes a snapshot of the primary DB instance then restores snapshot to AZ.

Determining Fail-over
- DB event subscriptions via email or SMS.
- View DB events via RDS console or API operations.
- View the current state of Multi-AZ deployment in console or API operations.
