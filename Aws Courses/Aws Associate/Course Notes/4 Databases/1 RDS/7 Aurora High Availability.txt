Aurora High Availability

High Availability
- Aurora keeps 6 copies of your data, 2 copies of data in each AZ accross 3 AZs.
- Designed to handle loss of up to 2 copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to 3 copies without affecting read availability.
- Automatic detection of failures and automatically repair disk segments

Aurora Global Database -> Aurora is globally distributed, there is no cross-region replication option.

Fault Tolerant
1) Automatic Failover -> Aurora flips the CNAME to a replica and promoting it to the primary.
2) If none exist, attempts to create a new DB in the same AZ.
3) If unable, tries creating new DB in another AZ.

Storage and Reliability
- Automated backups are enabled by default
- Backups do not impact performance
- Snapshots do not impact performance
- Can share snapshots with other AWS accounts

Aurora Scaling -> Dynamically adjust the number of Aurora read replicas provisioned for an Aurora DB cluster to handle changes in active connections or workload.
