- Used to increase performance.
- Allows retrieval from fast in-memory cache rather than slower disk based dbs.
- Sits between your application and your database
- Good for ready-heavy dbs that do not change frequently
- Good for storing results of compute intensive calculations
- Good for distributed session data management
