Parameter Group -> Group of parameters that apply to all databases you create in the cluster. 

Workload Management (WLM) -> WLM is part of the parameter group configuration. Allows you to define the number of query queues that are available and how queries are routed to those queues for processing. 
- Default WLM contains one queue that can run up to 5 queries concurently.
- Add additional queues and configure WLM properties if you want more control over query processing.
- Cannot modify default parameter group and default WLM, must create custom WLM and associate new parameter group to it.
