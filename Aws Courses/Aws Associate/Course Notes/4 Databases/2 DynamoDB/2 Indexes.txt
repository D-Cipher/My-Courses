Index Basics

Index -> Data structure that gives you a different view of your data to allow you to perform fast queries on specific table. 
- Select the columns of interest and run query against that index rather than the entire data set.

Two types:
1) Local Secondary Index -> allows you to use the same partition key, but a different sort key faster queries against.
- Can only be created when creating your table, cannot change it later.
- Can define up to 5 Local Secondary Indexes.

2) Global Secondary Index -> allows you to use a different partition and sort key to run faster queries against.
- Lets you choose a different partition key and differet sort key as the main table.
- Can be created at any time and can be changed.
- Can define up to 5 Global Secondary Indexes.
