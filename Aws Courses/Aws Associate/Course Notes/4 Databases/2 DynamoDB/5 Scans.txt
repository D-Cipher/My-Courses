Scans

Scan -> operation that examines every item in the table.
- By default, returns all data attributes.
- Can filter the results of the scan once it has pulled the entire table.
- ProjectionExpression -> parameter that allows scan to return specific attribute
- By default, scans process data sequentually in returning 1MB increments before retrieving the next 1MB.

Improving Scan Performance
- Set smaller page size to use fewer read operaions
- Use larger number of smaller operations
- Configure scan to use Parallel scans which logically divides table or index into segments and scans each segment in parallel.
