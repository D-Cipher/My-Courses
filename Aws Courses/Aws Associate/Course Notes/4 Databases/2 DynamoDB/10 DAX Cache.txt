DAX Cache

DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) -> fully managed clustered in-memory cache for DynamoDB
- Delivers 10x read performance 
- Ideal for read-heavy bursty workloads
- Write-through cache -> data is written to cache and back end store at the same time.
- Allows you to point API calls to DAX.
- Reduces the load on main table
- May reduce provisioned read capacity and save money.
- Caters to Eventually Consistent reads
- Not useful for write intensive apps

Cache Hit -> if item queried is in the cache it will return the result to the application

Cache Miss -> if item queried is not in the cache, dax will perform an eventually consistent read on DynamoDB
