Resource Groups

Resource Groups -> Use groups to organize your AWS resources. Resource groups make it easier to monitor, manage, and automate tasks on large numbers of resources at one time.
- Check health and status of various resources simultaneously
- Maintain seperate sets of resources in different stages (alpha, beta, release).
- Manage different versions of environments.
