Cloud Trail -> Record any activity of your AWS account used for auditing.

- CloudTrail is automatically enabled
- Encryption enabled by default

CloudTrail Event Logging:
- Management Events -> Insights into management operations performed on AWS
- Data Events -> Insights into resource operations performed on AWS 

Regional vs Global
- For most services, events are recorded in the region where the action occurred. 
- For global services, events are delivered to any trail that includes global services.
- Enable "--is-multi-region-trail" if multi-region is required.
- Enable "--include-global-service-events" if trial includes global services.

CloudTrail vs CloudWatch
- CloudTrail asks: who is provision what resource in AWS?
- CloudWatch asks: what is network through put or disk IO?
