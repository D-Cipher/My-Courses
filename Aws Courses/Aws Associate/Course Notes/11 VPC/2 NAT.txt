NAT Overview

Network Address Translation (NAT) -> Allows EC2 instances in private subnet to securely communicate out to the internet for software updates. 

NAT Instance -> Single EC2 instance used for NAT.
- When creating a NAT instance be sure to disable source and destination check on the instance
- NAT instances must be in a public subnet
- There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance
- Amount of traffic NAT instance can support depends on instance size.
- Bottlenecking could be a problem, need to increase instance size.
- Create high availability using Autoscaling groups and multiple subnets in different AZs, and script to automate failover.

NAT Gateway -> Highly available, secure, AWS provided EC2 instances spread across multiple AZs for you to use for NAT.
- Redundant inside the AZ
- Only have one NAT Gateway per one AZ.
- Start with 5G throughput scales to 45G.
- AWS will handle patching
- No need to disable source and destination check.
- NAT gateway in one AZ can be a single point of failure 

Bastion Host -> Special purpose computer specially designed to withstand attacks. Sits in the public subnet and only point of accesses into your private subnets.
- You can get bastion host AMIs from the aws community AMI market place
- Used to securely administer EC2 instances
- Cannot use a NAT Gateway as a Bastion host.
