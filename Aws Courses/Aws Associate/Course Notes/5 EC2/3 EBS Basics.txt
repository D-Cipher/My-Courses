Elastic Block Store (EBS)

EBS -> Elastic Block Store, allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances. A virtual hard disk in the cloud. 
- Supports Encryption and Snapshots
- Can provision capacity
- Can persist beyond the lifecycle of the EC2 instance
- Can stripe multiple volumes together to create larger volumes
- Data stored on EBS is automatically replicated within an AZ

Volumes -> virtual hard disk that exist on EBS

IOPS -> input output per second

EBS Types
1) General Purpose SSD (GP2) -> Balance price and performance 3 IOPS per GB, use case for most workloads.
2) Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1) -> Highest Performance SSD volume. Designed for IO intensive apps like large relational or NoSQL databases. Mission critical apps.
3) Throughput Optimized HHD (ST1) -> Data written in sequence for Data warehouses and Big data. It's magnetic. Cannot be boot volumes.
4) Cold HDD (SC1) -> Low cost infrequent services for file servers. It's megnetic. Cannot be boot volumes.
5) Magnetic (Standard) -> Lowest cost infrequent data storage. Bootable.

*Note you cannot mount 1 EBS to multiple EC2 instances.
*Termination protection is turned off by default.
*By default root EBS deleted when instance terminated.
*Root volumes can't be encrypted once created
*Note When taking a snapshot of root volume stop the instance first.

EBS Storage Cost Considerations:
1) Volumes Type
2) IOPs Type
3) Snapshot frequency and storage
4) Data transfer across regions
