EC2 Basics

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - web service provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. A computer in the cloud.

Pricing models
1) On Demand -> pay fixed rate by the hour with no commitment
2) Reserved Pricing -> capacity reservation for 1 to 3 year terms. Reserved instances cannot be moved between regions.
3) Spot Pricing -> bid for a price you want for instant capacity, supply and demand. If a spot instance is terminated you will not be charged for partial hour of usage, but if you terminate you will be charged.
4) Dedicated Hosts -> Physical EC2 dedicated for your use, paid by the hour.

On Demand
- good for users that want low cost no up-front payment or commitment
- short term, spiky, unpredictable workloads that cannot be interupted
- application testing

Reserved Pricing
1) Standard Reserved -> long term contracts thats 75% off on demand instances, longer the contract longer the discount.
- Less flexibility in reconfiguring and you cannot move between regions

2) Convertible Reserved -> Allows you to change between different instance types, 54% off on demand instances.
- Allows more flexibility in moving and reconfiguring the instance

3) Scheduled Reserved Instances -> Reserve capacity for specific windows of time that is predictable and reoccurring, think a school with scheduled hours.

Spot Pricing
- Applications with flexible start and end times
- Available for low compute prices
- Feasible for urgent computing needs for large amounts of capacity

Dedicated Hosts
- Good for regulatory requirements where not allowed for multi-tenant virtualization.
- Good for licensing requirements 
- Can be purchased On-Demand
- Can be purchased as reserved

EC2 Compute Cost Considerations:
1) Clock hours of server time
2) Machine configurations
3) Machine purchase type
4) Number of instances
5) Load balancing
6) Detailed monitoring
7) Auto Scaling
8) Elastic IP addresses
9) Operating systems and software packages

EC2 Instance types
F1 -> Field Prorammable Gate Array, hardware acceleration
I3 -> IOPS intensive, High speed storage, NoSQL data warehousing
G3 -> Graphics/GPU for videos and gaming
H1 -> High Disk Throughput, for MapReduce workloads
T3 -> Low cost general purpose Web servers, small dbs
D2 -> Dense Storage, Fileservers, Data Warehousing, Hadoop
R5 -> RAM intensive, memory intensive apps and dbs
M5 -> General Purpose, application servers
C5 -> Compute Optimized, DBs and CPU intensive apps and dbs
P3 -> General purpose GPU for machine learning, Bit Coin mining
X1 -> Extreme Memory optimized, SAP Apache Spark
Z1D -> High Compute capacity and high memory, electronics design automation
A1 -> Arm based workloads, scale-out workloads to web servers
U-6tb1 -> Bare Metal capabilities for eliminating virtualized overhead

*Note: one subnet goes to one availability zone.
