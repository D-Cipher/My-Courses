Auto Scaling

Auto Scaling -> service allows for scalable resources, used for applications that experience variable load.
- AWS Auto Scaling allows you to select your applications based on resource tags or AWS CloudFormation stacks. 
- Create scaling plan for your application, defines how each of the resources in your application should be scaled. 
- Create target track scaling policy, AG keeps scale at target value based scaling strategy. 
- Choose from three predefined strategies: optimize availability, optimize costs, or balance the two. 
- Set your own strategy: define your target values, set the min/max values for the resources.
- Auto Scaling is free to use


Types of Scaling:
1) Vertical Scaling (scaling up) -> Changing the size of the instance for more compute or memory.

2) Horizontal Scaling (scaling out) -> Changing the number of instances for more compute or memory

Auto Scaling Groups -> Easy way to scale a service horizontally.
- Launch or terminate instances
- Automatically register new instances with load balancers
- Can launch across AZs

How it works:
- ELB balances the load across our instances
- CloudWatch monitors the instances' health
- CloudWatch sends an alarm if CPU utilization level is exceeded
- Auto Scaling Policy intercepts the alarm and determines how many instances to launch and what kind of instance it should be.

Launching ASGs
1) Launch Configurations -> allows you to set up the configurations that your ASGs will use to scale.
- Can specify EC2 instance size and AMI name
- Can specify time you want the scaling to happen.

2) Auto Scaling Group 
- References the launch configurations
- Specifies min, max, and desired number of instances
- May reference an ELB
- Specifies healh check type

3) Auto Scaling Policy
- Specifies how much to scale (in or out)
- Multiple policies may be attached to ASG

Monitoring -> CloudWatch lets the ASG know when to scale in and when to scale out.
- CloudWatch monitors: CPU utilization, Network metrics, Queue Size
- CloudWatch Logs -> stores the data
- Provides default and custom metrics

Load Balancing -> Elastic Load Balancer distributes traffic across the instances.
- Each time ASG creates an instance it will register it with the ELB.
