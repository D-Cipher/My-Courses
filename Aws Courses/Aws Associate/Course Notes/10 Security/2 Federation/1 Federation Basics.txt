Federation

Web Identity Federation -> Allows users, with web identities from identity provider, to have access to AWS resources.
- Role assigned using Security Token Service (STS)
- Allow users to authenticate with Mobile Apps and Web Apps
- Integrates with OpenID Connect identity providers such as Amazon, Facebook, Google

Identity Providers -> manage identities outside of AWS giving external user identities permissions to use AWS resources.
- Useful if your organization already has its own identity system, such corporate directory. 
- Useful if you are creating a mobile app or web application that requires access to AWS resources.

JSON Web Token (JWT) -> Token usead to authenticate user from identity provider. JWT token exchanged for aws temporary credentials (role, identity pools) for access to aws resources.

Federation can come from three sources:
1) Active Directory
2) Identity providers such as OpenID
3) Cross account access though another AWS account

Federation Process:
1) User authenticates against identity provider 
2) User obtain temporary authentication token
3) Identity provider API call AssumedRoleWithWebIdentity
4) User accesses AWS resources
