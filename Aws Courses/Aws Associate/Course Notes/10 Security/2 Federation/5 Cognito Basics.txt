Cognito

Cognito -> Allows users to authenticate with an identity provider which they trade for temporary AWS security credentials which map to an IAM role that gives access to AWS resources.
- Allows users to sign-up and sign-in to your applications.
- Access for guest users
- Acts as an Identity Broker between your application and web id providers so you don't need additional code.
- Syncs user data across multiple devices.
- No need to store AWS credentials locally.
- Recommended federation for mobile.
- MFA compatible
- Behind cognito is actually making the call to STS API on your behalf. Hence, you do not need to explicitly call the API.
