Kinesis Client Library

Kinesis Client Library (KCL) -> Downloaded on to consumer, ensures that every shard is processed by the record processor.
- Manages number of record processors relative to the number of shards and consumers
- Load balances job across all of the record processors
- Tracks number of shards in the stream
- Discovers new shards when resharding

Consumers -> Instances that are consuming the data, using the Kinesis Client Library.

Scaling out:
- Number of instances should not exceed number of shards except for failover purposes
- You never need multiple instances to handle processing one shard
- You can have one consumer processing multiple shards, hence even if more shards are added does not necessarily mean you need to add more consumers.
- Use CPU utilization to determine quantity of consumers (not number of shards).
- Use ASGs to scale based on CPU utilization load on your consumers
