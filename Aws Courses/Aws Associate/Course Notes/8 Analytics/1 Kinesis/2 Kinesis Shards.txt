Kinesis Shards

Shards -> Sequence of data records in a stream, each with unique sequence number.
- Base throughput unit of the stream.
- Kinesis stream is made up of a set of multiple shards. 
- Data capacity of stream is sum capacity of the shards.
- Shards are added and removed as throughput changes.

Shard Capacity
- 5 reads per second, up to max of 2MB per second
- 1K writes per second, up to max of 1MB per second

Enhanced Fan-out -> When enabled, shard provides 1MB/sec data input 2MB/sec data output for each consumer. If not using fan-out then data output is shared.

UpdateShardCount -> API call lets you adjust the number of shards in your stream to adapt to changes in the rate of data flow through the stream.

Shard split -> Increases the number of shards in your stream and therefore increases the data capacity of the stream. Because you are charged on a per-shard basis it increases cost of your stream.

Shard merge -> Reduces the number of shards in your stream and therefore decreases the data capacity and decrease cost of the stream.
