CloudFormation

CloudFormation -> Create and deploy related AWS resources together as a unit. 
- Lets you describe your architectures in JSON templates 
- Makes it very easy to make copies of your architecture.
- Use declarative programing languages to deply AWS resources
- Use templates and stacks to provision resources
- Create, update, and delete sets of resources as a single unit or stack. 
- You can relaunch your architecture from scratch.
- Duplicate resources from your VPC.

IMPORTANT: CloudFormation is Global, but there maybe regional differences in services, make sure to use MAPPINGS to define those specifications.

Stack -> A unit of resources that are deployed together, described using JSON. 

Quick Starts -> you can access pre-built templates to create and deploy complex cloud environments and stand them up very quickly. https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/

Updating Stacks:
- Direct update -> directly update stack
- Change Set -> preview changes first before deploy
