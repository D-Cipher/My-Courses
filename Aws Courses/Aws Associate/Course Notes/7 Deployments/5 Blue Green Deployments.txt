Blue Green Deployments

Blue Green Deployment -> Having an active (blue) and passive (green) environment for your application, where blue is the environment that is in production and green is a copy where you do your development.
- When development is finished, simply do a swap and green becomes blue.
- Easy and safe way to do deployments
- More expensive than in-place upgrade because you need to launch new environment

Advantages:
1) Provides level of isolation between application environments
2) Easy to roll back changes, simply swap production back to original blue
3) Minimizes application downtime
