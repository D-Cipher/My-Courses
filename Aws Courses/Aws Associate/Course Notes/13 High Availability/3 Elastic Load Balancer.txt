Elastic Load Balancer 

Load Balancer -> Device that is designed to help you balance the load across multiple webservers.
- You need at least 2 PUBLIC subnets in your VPC in order to provision a load balancer
- Three types: Application, Network, and Classic.

Application Load balancers (ALB) -> Best suited for balancing HTTP/HTTPS. Application aware meaning intelligently load balance based on detected changes.
- layer 7 application level
- Sees all the changes to the Http and make decisions on load balancing  

Network Load balancers (NLB) -> Balance TCP Protocol for Performance. 
- Operates at the layer 4 connection level.
- Capible of handling millions of request per second.

Classic Load balancers -> Cost effective legacy elastic load balancer.
- Can load balance HTTP/HTTPS application
- Can use layer 7 specific features like X-Forwarded and sticky sessions
- Not Application aware
- Can use strict layer 4 load balancing

504 Error -> Gateway has timed out, application not responding, look at the web server layer or db layer.
