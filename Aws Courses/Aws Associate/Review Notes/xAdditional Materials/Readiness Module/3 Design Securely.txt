Design Secure Architectures

Shared responsibility model -> security principle of responsibility of security between AWS and customer
- AWS responsible for security OF the cloud: AWS infrastructure and AWS services
- Customer responsible for security IN the cloud: Client / Server / Network Traffic Encryption, OS / Network / Firewall configurations, Platform / Apps / IAM, Customer Content

Principle of least privilege -> you want to grant users the minimal amount of privileges for the activities they need to perform.

1. Determine how to Secure Application Tiers
- Identity Access Management (IAM)

2. Determine how to Secure Data
Data in Transit:
- SSL over the web
- VPN for IPsec
- IPsec over AWS Direct Connect
- Import/Export with Snowball
- AWS API calls use HTTPS/SSL by default

Data at Rest:
- S3 -> private by default, HTTP or HTTPS, audit log, Bucket Policy, ACL integration. Supports Encryption.
- EBS -> Encryption

3. Define the networking infrastructure
- VPC
