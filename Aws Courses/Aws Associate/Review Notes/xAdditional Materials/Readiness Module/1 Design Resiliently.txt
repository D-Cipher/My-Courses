Design Resiliant Architectures

1. Choose reliable/resilient storage.
Disk/Block Storage:
- Instance Store
- Elastic Block Storage
- Elastic File Storage

Object storage:
- S3 Standard
- S3-IA
- S3-IA One Zone
- S3 Intelligent Tiering
- Glacier
- Glacier Deep Archive

2. Design decoupling mechanisms using AWS
- SQS
- Elastic Load Balancer
- Elastic IP

3. Design multi-tier architecture - naturally decoupled
- CloudFormation
- Serverless Applications: Lambda

4. Design high availability and/or fault tolerant solutions
- instead of treating failure as an unusual exceptional event, treat it as a normal operational event.
- high availability -> ability of a system or system component to be always operational.  
- fault tolerant -> user does not experience any inpact or reduction in performance from a fault
