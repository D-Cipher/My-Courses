Design Performat

1. Choose performant storage and databases
Choosing Disk/Block Storage:
- SSD -> more expensive and perform better for IOPS
- HDD -> less expensve and perform better for sequential read/write

Off-loading static content:
- Store static files to S3, frees up webserver to deliver dynamic content.

Databases:
- RDS
- DynamoDB
- Redshift

2. Apply caching to improve performance
Web Level Caching:
- CloudFront -> Content delivery network (CDN) that provides web level caching

App and DB Level Caching:
- ElastiCache -> memcached and redis

3. Design for elasticity and scalability
- Auto Scaling Groups
- ELB
- CloudWatch
