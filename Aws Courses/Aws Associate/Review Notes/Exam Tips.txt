Exam Tips
1) Circle "Choose two" or "Choose three" and make sure you are picking the right number of choices with these question types.

2) "1 Availability Zone" is always wrong (except for sometimes S3-IA one zone). 
Example: 
An application runs on EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. The application runs optimally on 9 instances and must have at least 6 running instances to maintain minimally acceptable performance for a short period of time. Which is the most cost-effective Auto Scaling group configuration that meets this requirement?
a) 9 instances across 2 AZs
b) 9 instances across 3 AZs [Correct]
c) 12 instances across 2 AZs 
d) 9 instances across 1 AZ [WRONG BECAUSE 1 AZ]

3) Look out for fake AWS services that don't exist. Eliminate them.
Example: 
You need an easily accessible solution, but still keep your storage costs to a minimum, and it does not matter if some objects are lost. With these factors in mind, which storage media should you use to keep costs as low as possible?
a) Glacier
b) S3 - Provisioned IOPS [NOT A SERVICE] 
c) S3 - Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) [NOT A SERVICE]
d) S3 - One Zone-Infrequent Access [Correct]
