#Setup EC2 Guide

This is a guide on launching an instance of Amazon Web Service's EC2 Virtual Server.

##Objective
Once set up, we should be able to SSH into our EC2 via the command line (Linux, MAC). For windows, PuTTY (see PuTTY guide).

In the command line:
'''
ssh ec2-user@54.209.96.172 -i
'''


##Selecting and Configuring
1) In the AWS console select EC2
2) Choose a virtual machine, ei: "Amazon Linux AMI 2016.09.1 (HVM)"
3) Choose a virtual disk, ei: "General purpose t2.micro"

4) Configure instance details
Important: select an IAM role. If you do not have a role create a new IAM role. This will allow you to CLI using roles instead using credentials. This way no credentials are stored on the instance. For more details see "Setup IAM Guide".
'''
IAM role = "S3-Admin-Access"
'''


5) Add Storage (default is fine)
6) Add a tag, specifically name.
'''
Key = "Name", Value = "EC2-testMachine" 
'''

##Security Config
Very importantly, we need to setup security group.

1) Select create new security group

2) Give the security group a name, ei: "WebDMZ"

3) Add rules, standard are SSH and HTTP
'''
Type = "SSH", Protocol = "TCP", Port Range = "22", Source = "Custom", "0.0.0.0/0"

Type = "HTTP", Protocol = "TCP", Port Range = "80", Source = "Custom", "0.0.0.0/0, ::/0"
'''

##Key Pair
We now need to set up a EC2 key on our computer. 

1) Hit Launch and a pop up will prompt you for a key pair. If you have a key you can select "Choose an existing key pair".

2) If you do not have a key pair choose "Create new key pair" and download key pair. 

For windows users you will need to convert key pair to PuTTY key. See PuTTY key guide for instructions on this.

Save key and note the location, ei: MyEC2Key.pem

##SSH into EC2
Congrats your first EC2 is Launched. Now to access (for Linux and Mac), in the command line type in "ssh ec2-user@" and the public ip address of your EC2 instance, ei:
'''
ssh ec2-user@54.209.96.172 -i MyEC2Key.pem
'''
