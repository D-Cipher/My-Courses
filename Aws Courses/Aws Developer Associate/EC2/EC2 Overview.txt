EC2 Overview

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - web service provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. A computer in the cloud.

Pricing models:
-On Demand = pay fixed rate by the hour with no commitment
-Reserved = capacity reservation for 1 to 3 year terms
-Spot = bid for a price you want for instant capacity, supply and demand. If a spot instance is terminated you will not be charged for partial hour of usage, but if you terminate you will be charged.

Instance types:
T2 - Low cost general purpose Web servers
M3, M4 - General Purpose for App servers
C3, C4 - Compute Optimized, DBs and CPU intensive apps
R3 - RAM intensive, memory intensive apps
G2 - Graphics/GPU
I2 - IOPS intensive, High speed storage, NoSQL data warehousing
D2 - Dense Storage, Fileservers, Hadoop


EBS
Create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances. A disk in the cloud.
-IOPS = input output per second

Volume types:
-General Purpose SSD (GP2) - 3 IOPS per GB
-Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1) - Designed for IO intensive apps like large relational or NoSQL databases.
-Magnatic - low cost infrequent services for file servers.
