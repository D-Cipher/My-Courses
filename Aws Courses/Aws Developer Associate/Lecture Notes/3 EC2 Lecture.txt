EC2 Overview

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - web service provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. A computer in the cloud.

Pricing models:
-On Demand = pay fixed rate by the hour with no commitment
-Reserved = capacity reservation for 1 to 3 year terms
-Spot = bid for a price you want for instant capacity, supply and demand. If a spot instance is terminated you will not be charged for partial hour of usage, but if you terminate you will be charged.
-Dedicated Hosts = Physical EC2 dedicated for your use paid by the hour.

Instance types (DrMcGiftPx):
D2 - Dense Storage, Fileservers, Hadoop
R3, R4 - RAM intensive, memory intensive apps
M3, M4 - General Purpose web servers
C3, C4 - Compute Optimized, DBs and CPU intensive apps
G2 - Graphics/GPU for video and gaming
I2 - IOPS intensive, High speed storage, NoSQL data warehousing
F1 - Field Programmable Gateway, hardware acceleration
T2 - Low cost general purpose Web servers
P2 - General purpose GPU for machine learning, Bit Coin mining
X1 - Extreme Memory optimized, SAP Apache Spark


*Note: one subnet goes to one availability zone.


Volumes:
EBS - Elastic Block Storage, allows you to reate storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances. A disk in the cloud.
-IOPS = input output per second
Volumes - virtual hard disk that exist on EBS

Volume types:
-General Purpose SSD (GP2) - Balance price and performance 3 IOPS per GB
-Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1) - Designed for IO intensive apps like large relational or NoSQL databases.
-Magnatic Throughput Optimized HHD (ST1) - Data written in sequence for Data warehouses and Big data. Cannot be boot volumes.
-Magnatic Cold HDD (SC1) - Low cost infrequent services for file servers. Cannot be boot volumes
-Magnetic (Standard) - Lowest cost infrequent data storage. Bootable.

*Note you cannot mount 1 EBS to multiple EC2 instances.
*Termination protection is turned off by default.
*By default root EBS deleted when instance terminated.
*Root volumes can't be encrypted.
*Note When taking a snapshot of root volume stop the instance first.

Snapshots - are incremental point in time copies of volumes, exist on S3.

Security Groups - Virtual firewall. One instance can have multiple security groups, and add rules to each security group to allow traffic from and to your website.
-Any rule change you make to your security group applies immediately.
-Security group rules are stateful, meaning for any inbound rules outbound rules are added automatically.

SDKs:
-Android, IOS, JavaScript
