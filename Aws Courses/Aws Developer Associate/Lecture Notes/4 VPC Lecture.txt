VPC Overview

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - lets you provision an isolated section of AWS where you can launch your AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You chave full control over the virtual network, including:
-Assign IP address range
-private facing subnets with no internet access
-Configure routing tables
-Create internet network gateway attached to VPC (one gateway per VPC)
-Subnet network access control list, these are stateless meaning inbound and outbound traffic must be specified.

Note: one subnet per availability zone.

IP Address Ranges:
10.0.0.0 - corporate internal address
172.16.0.0 - 12 prefix
192.168.0.0 - home addresses

Default VPCs:
All subnets in default VPC have a route out to the internet. Each EC2 instance has both a public and private IP address. If you delete the default VPC the only way to get it back is to contact AWS, so don't delete it!!

VPC Peering - Allows you to connect one VPC with another via direct network route using a private IP address.
Note: Peering is in a star configuration, NO TRANSITIVE peering.
